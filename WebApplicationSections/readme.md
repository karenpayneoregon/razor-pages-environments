# Razor Partial Views

> **Note**
> From Microsoft: A partial view is a Razor markup file (.cshtml) without an @page directive that renders HTML output within another markup file's rendered output.

The term *partial view* is used when developing a Razor Pages app, where markup files are called pages. This topic generically refers to MVC views and Razor Pages pages as markup files.
