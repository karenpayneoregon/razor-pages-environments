# Razor Partial Views

> **Note**
> From Microsoft: A partial view is a Razor markup file (.cshtml) without an @page directive that renders HTML output within another markup file's rendered output.

The term *partial view* is used when developing a Razor Pages app, where markup files are called pages. This topic generically refers to MVC views and Razor Pages pages as markup files.

# Passing data to a partial view

In Index.cshtml the section on the right is populated using `Html.RenderPartialAsync` which streams the rendered output directly to the response. Because the method doesn't return a result, it must be called within a Razor code block as in the second image below.

The class `PageContainer` has several properties to show that any type of data can be passed to the partial view and in this case only the `Page` property is set to `CurrentPage.Index`, in `_IndexPartial.cshtml` there is a `switch` statement which decides which page to render mocked data from `MockedPageContents` which here is static data but can come from data in a database for instance.

For both `Index` and `About` pages mocked data is used to populate the right side container on the respective pages.

```csharp
public class PageContainer
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public DateOnly DateOnly { get; set; }
    public CurrentPage Page { get; set; }
}
```

The `Contact` page passes a string as a key value pair and the model, Contacts from EF Core.

```csharp
@{
    var data = new ViewDataDictionary(ViewData) { { "Name", "Karen Payne sample" } };
    await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_ContactsPartial", Model.Contacts, data);
}
```

In `_ContactsPartial` page the key value is retrived using `ViewData`

```csharp
var personName = ViewData["Name"];
```

From here, the first five contacts are presented using a foreach statement.

To present the key/value, `personName is {}` is the same as `personName is not null`

```csharp
if (personName is {})
{
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8"></div><div class="col-3 text-dark fw-bold">@personName</div>
    </div>   
}
```

# Database

The `Contacts` Page requires a database. Before running this project, create the `NorthWind` database by running the script in the <kbd>Scripts</kbd> folder using Microsoft SQL-Server Management Studio (SSMS) or run the script and if so make sure to check the path in the script file first to ensure it matches the path where you databases are located.

## Database connections

The connection string resides in `appsettings.json` and is read using the following NuGet package [![](assets/Link_16x.png)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConfigurationLibrary/)

# Bootstap

For those who have never explored possibilities with this library, take the time to learn from read their docs [![](assets/Link_16x.png)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) and what has been done in this project including inspecting break-points in `site.css`

Minimal use of [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) has been used and was added via libman [![](assets/Link_16x.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/libman-vs?view=aspnetcore-6.0).
